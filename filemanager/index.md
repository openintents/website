### Information for developers
Third party developers can use OI File Manager through simple intents to present an "Open file", "Save file", or "Select folder" activity.

The file manager features PICK_FILE and PICK_DIRECTORY intents:

Intent intent = new Intent("org.openintents.action.PICK_FILE");
startActivityForResult(intent, 1);

You can provide a pre-selected file or folder by setting data through setData() to a file URI, like "file:///sdcard/notepad.csv". The picked file URI can be obtained in onActivityResult() through getData().

With the extras "org.openintents.extra.TITLE" and "org.openintents.extra.BUTTON_TEXT" one can further customize the PICK intent (e.g. display "Open file" or "Save file" in the title bar).

### Sample application TestFileManager
TestFileManager is a small sample application that showcases interaction of third party applications with the OI File Manager.

It shows a (dummy) input field for the file name or folder name, and three buttons to initiate the "open", "save", and "select folder" intents. Once OI File Manager returns, the selected name is put into the input field. No data is actually opened or saved, since this is just a small demo.

This is how the "open" activity can look like:

And this is how you can select a folder:

Note that you can customize the activities by proving extras for the title and the button text.

Details can be found in the sample application TestFileManager. You can download it from the download page, or access the latest version in the public repository.
